I am fascinated by how mosquitoes and other disease vectors may adapt to climate change. Check out our review on this topic [here!](https://elifesciences.org/articles/69630) 

A key component of adaptive potential is whether there is currently variation (phenotypic and genetic) in thermal tolerance, both within and between mosquito populations. But for nearly all mosquito species, this is information we don't have. To address this, I'm investigating variation in mosquito thermal tolerance using the western tree hole mosquito, *Aedes sierrensis* as a model system. I'm part of a team in the Mordecai lab collecting larval *Ae. sierrensis* from across the species range (roughly Southern California to Alaska), rearing them in the lab, and conducting experiemnts to measure thermal performance across the life span. I'm pairing these direct thermal performance measurements with genomic data to understand the genetic basis of thermal tolerance and the extent of genetic variation in thermal tolerance between and within mosquito populaitons

## [Impacts of climate change on Lyme disease in the U.S.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15435) ##

Lyme disease cases have been increasing in the U.S. in recent decades. Despite well known associations between aspects of weather and climate and tick life cycles, the role of climate *change* in this increase in cases was unclear. Isolating the impact of climate change on cases is difficult due to changes in other known drivers like public and physician awareness of ticks, land cover, income, and changes in Lyme disease case definitions.  Using a statistical modeling approach that could account for concurrent changes in these drivers, we were able to isolate the effect of climate on U.S. Lyme disease cases in the past 18 years. We found that the strongest climate-disease association was between warming annual temperatures and increasing incidence in the Northeast. Our Lyme disease projections indicated that cases in the Northeast will increase significantly by 2050, but only under an upper climate change scenario (RCP8.5), and with large uncertainty around this projected increase.

## [Impacts of drought on an ongoing biological invasion](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.3476) ## 

Invasive species and climate change are independently two of the greatest threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Further, climate change may alter invasion dynamics, but this is challenging to study given the context-dependence of invasions and the need for long-term datasets. Stanford’s Biological Preserve — Jasper Ridge — is home to one of the most complete, long-term surveys of a biological invasion — a  Northern California ant community invaded by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), which has been surveyed from 1993 to the present. This period captured regional changes in temperature and precipitation including a ‘once-in-a-millennium’ drought event from 2012-2015. Using the ant survey data and a structural equation modeling approach, we found the strongest impact on the spread of the Argentine ant was from *direct* effects of climate, namely cumulative precipitation and summer maximum temperatures, with only a negligible role for biotic resistance from native ants. This suggests that increasing drought and high temperature extremes, as projected for northern California due to anthropogenic driven climate change, may limit the spread, and possibly the impact, of the Argentine ant in invaded regions.

## Role of the tick microbiome in Lyme disease transmission ##

The ability for vector species to acquire, maintain, and transmit pathogens (‘vector competence’) is a key component of disease transmission to humans and a potential target for disease control. In some vector-borne disease systems, the microbial community living inside the vector has been found to play a large role in pathogen transmission. However the role of the vector microbiome (here, the western black-legged tick) on Lyme disease transmission on the west coast had not previously been investigated. I was part of a team in the [Swei lab that found](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.28.441694v1.abstract) that the host species on which a tick fed altered its microbiome in surprising ways. Specifically, feeding on the western fence lizard — a highly inhospitable host for the Lyme disease pathogen — led to a clearing of the tick microbiome, which facilitated *increased* pathogen transmission in the subsequent tick life stage. [My prior research](https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-020-3893-x) also found that the black-legged and western black-legged ticks (the two vectors of Lyme disease in the U.S., found in the eastern/midwestern U.S. respectively) were equally able to acquire their respective local strains of the Lyme disease pathogen, and equally less able to acquire non-local strains. Further, we found that while the western black-legged tick had higher attachment rates on rodent hosts, they were less efficient at transmitting the Lyme disease pathogen than the black-legged tick (their eastern / midwestern counterpart), which may contribute to lower disease transmission rates on the west coast.
