# Current Research # 

I am fascinated by [how mosquitoes and other disease vectors may adapt to climate change.] (https://elifesciences.org/articles/69630) 

A key component of adaptive potential is whether there is currently variation (phenotypic and genetic) in thermal tolerance, both within and between mosquito populations. But for nearly all mosquito species, this is information we don't have. To address this, I'm investigating variation in mosquito thermal tolerance using the western tree hole mosquito, *Aedes sierrensis* as a model system. I'm part of a team in the Mordecai lab collecting larval *Ae. sierrensis* from across the species range (roughly Southern California to Alaska), rearing them in the lab, and conducting experiemnts to measure thermal performance across the life span. I'm pairing these direct thermal performance measurements with genomic data to understand the genetic basis of thermal tolerance and the extent of genetic variation in thermal tolerance between and within mosquito populaitons
