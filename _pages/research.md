My research focuses on two central questions: 
1) What is the impact of global change on the distribution and dynamics of vector-borne disease?
2) How might vectors adapt to warming through ecological and evolutionary mechanisms?

# Impact of global change on vector-borne disease #

## [Climate change & Lyme disease in the U.S.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15435) ##

Lyme disease cases have been increasing in the U.S. in recent decades. Despite well known associations between aspects of weather and climate and tick life cycles, the role of climate *change* in this increase in cases was unclear. Isolating the impact of climate change on cases is difficult due to changes in other known drivers like public and physician awareness of ticks, land cover, income, and changes in Lyme disease case definitions.  Using a statistical modeling approach that could account for concurrent changes in these drivers, we were able to isolate the effect of climate on U.S. Lyme disease cases in the past 18 years. We found that the strongest climate-disease association was between warming annual temperatures and increasing incidence in the Northeast. Our Lyme disease projections indicated that cases in the Northeast will increase significantly by 2050, but only under an upper climate change scenario (RCP8.5), and with large uncertainty around this projected increase.

Projected change in Lyme disease cases for 2100 shown at the county level under the (a) upper (RCP8.5) and (b) moderate (RCP4.5) climate change scenarios. Case changes refer to raw case counts rather than incidence and are relative to hindcasted values for 2010â€“2020. All counties within the Mountain Prairie are shown in gray as this region was not included in the analysis.

# Vectors adapting to climate warming #

I am fascinated by how mosquitoes and other disease vectors may adapt to climate change. Check out our review on this topic [here!](https://elifesciences.org/articles/69630) 

A key component of adaptive potential is whether there is currently variation (phenotypic and genetic) in thermal tolerance, both within and between mosquito populations. But for nearly all mosquito species, this is information we don't have. To address this, I'm investigating variation in mosquito thermal tolerance using the western tree hole mosquito, *Aedes sierrensis* as a model system. I'm part of a team in the Mordecai lab collecting larval *Ae. sierrensis* from across the species range (roughly Southern California to Alaska), rearing them in the lab, and conducting experiemnts to measure thermal performance across the life span. I'm pairing these direct thermal performance measurements with genomic data to understand the genetic basis of thermal tolerance and the extent of genetic variation in thermal tolerance between and within mosquito populaitons
