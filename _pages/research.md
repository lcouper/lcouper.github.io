# Current Research # 

I am currently fascinated by how mosquitoes and other disease vectors may adapt to climate change, specic. See our review and framing of this topic [here](https://elifesciences.org/articles/69630) 

A key component of adaptive potential is whether there is currently variation (phenotypic and genetic) in thermal tolerance, both within and between mosquito populations. But for nearly all mosquito species, this is information we don't have. To address this, I'm investigating variation in mosquito thermal tolerance using the western tree hole mosquito, *Aedes sierrensis* as a model system.
