I care deeply about expanding educational and research opportunities to a wider audience. Please see below for some analysis tutorials I've put together to share analytical approaches commonly used in ecology, evolution, and epidemiology, as well as the full materials for an introductory R programming course (including lecture notes, homeworks, and solutions).

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or feedback about these materials!

- [Panel regression](https://github.com/lcouper/AnalysisTutorials/tree/main/PanelRegression)  ðŸ“ˆ
- [Gradient boosted machines](https://github.com/lcouper/AnalysisTutorials/tree/main/GradientBoostedMachines) ðŸŒ³
- [Mechanistic transmission modeling](https://github.com/lcouper/AnalysisTutorials/tree/main/MechanisticTransmissionModel) ðŸ¦Ÿ 
- Case-crossover (will be posted soon) ðŸ˜·
- [WGS analysis including](https://github.com/lcouper/MosquitoThermalSelection/tree/main/Sequence_Analysis) ðŸ§¬ :
  - sequence data processing
  - variant calling
  - GWA

Note these were made with guidance and contributions from: Erin Mordecai, Caroline Glidden, Mauricio Cruz-Loya, Marta Shocket, Jennifer Head, and Mark Bitter

## Statistical Programming for Biology: Introduction to R ##

I have also put together an Introductory R Programming course, geared towards learning R for biological applications. This course was offered at SFSU in 2018 and Foothill College in 2022. All course materials remain freely available [here](https://github.com/lcouper/RprogrammingCourse)
