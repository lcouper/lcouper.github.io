Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in Biology at Stanford University, interested in the impacts of global change on infectious disease. My research focuses on how climate change may alter the distribution of vector-borne disease and how vectors may adapt to warming through ecological and evolutionary mechanisms. This research involves a combination of field work, lab experiments, genomics, and mathematical and statistical modeling.
