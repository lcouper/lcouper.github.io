I am currently a postdoc in Environmental Health Sciences at UC Berkeley with Justin Remais. I received my PhD in Biology from Stanford University working with Erin Mordecai. My research investigates the impacts of global change on environmentally-mediated diseases and asks: (1) How is global change impacting infectious diseae transmission? and (2) How are pathogens and vectors adapting in response?
