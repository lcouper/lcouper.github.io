I am currently a postdoc in the Division of Environmental Health Sciences at UC Berkeley, working with Justin Remais. I received my PhD in Biology from Stanford University and was advised by Erin Mordecai. Iâ€™m broadly interested in the impacts of global change on infectious disease ecology and evolution. My research focuses on how climate change may alter the distribution of vector-borne diseases and how vectors may adapt to warming through ecological and evolutionary mechanisms. This work involves a combination of field work, lab experiments, genomics, and mathematical and statistical modeling. 

Outside of lab, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and am fortunate to be part of an incredible team, [Fury](http://furyultimate.com).
