I am currently a postdoc in Environmental Health Sciences at UC Berkeley with Justin Remais. I received my PhD in Biology from Stanford University working with Erin Mordecai. My research investigates the biology and epidemiology of infectious diseases in a changing world. This includes understanding: How does environmental change impact the emergence and spread of disease? What is the causal effect of environmental change on disease incidence? How are pathogens and vectors adapting in response?
