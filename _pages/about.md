I am currently a postdoc in Environmental Health Sciences at UC Berkeley with Justin Remais. I received my PhD in Biology from Stanford University working with Erin Mordecai. Iâ€™m broadly interested in the impacts of global change on infectious disease ecology and evolution. My research investigates the impacts of global change on environmentally-mediated diseases and focuses on two main questions: (1) What are the specific aspects of global change that drive disease transmission? and (2) What is the potential for rapid adaptation in infectious disease systems?
