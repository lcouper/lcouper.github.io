Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in Biology at Stanford University, interested in the impacts of global change on infectious disease ecology and evolution. My research focuses on how climate change may alter the distribution of vector-borne diseases and how vectors may adapt to warming through ecological and evolutionary mechanisms. This involves a combination of field work, lab experiments, genomics, and mathematical and statistical modeling. 

Outside of lab, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and am fortunate to be part of an incredible team, [Fury](http://furyultimate.com).
